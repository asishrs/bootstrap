###Open a Port on CentOS or RHEL 7

Starting with CentOS and RHEL 7, firewall rule settings are managed by firewalld service daemon. 
A command-line client called *firewall-cmd* can talk to this daemon to update firewall rules permanently.

To open up a new port (e.g., TCP/80) permanently, use these commands.

```
$ sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
Without "--permanent" flag, the firewall rule would not persist across reboots.

Check the updated rules with:
```
$ firewall-cmd --list-all
```
